# AWS Budget Forecast Notification
## 8_budget-notif-to-new-sns-all-services

Configuration in this directory creates set of AWS resources which may be sufficient for a fully working stage or prod
Terraform module - creates an AWS Budget with notification via SNS enabled with optional sns topic
creation (or use a pre-existing one) to alert when a U$S (currency actually configurable) budget forecasted threshold % is reached
(currently 100% of the `limit_amount`).

Provides an AWS budget resource (`aws_budgets_budget`). Budgets use the cost visualisation provided by **Cost Explorer** to show
you the status of your budgets, to provide forecasts of your estimated costs, and to track your AWS usage, including your free tier usage.

Please check the **input parameters** for a better understanding of it.

## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Or if using the `Makefile` in this repo you need to execute:

```bash
$ make init
$ make plan
$ make apply
```

Note that this example may create resources which can cost money (AWS EC2, for example). Run `terraform destroy` or `make destroy`
when you don't need these resources.
